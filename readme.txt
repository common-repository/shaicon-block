== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my icon not changing color? =

Shaicon Block includes controls for the icon's color and background. However, if your SVG icon has hard-coded color/fill values, the plugin will respect those instead of any applied custom colors.

= Why is the block not working for certain users? =

WordPress only allows Administrators and Editors to save "Unfiltered HTML" content, which includes SVGs. Shaicon Block will not work properly for users who are at the Author level or lower.

Note that WordPress multisite installations have additional restrictions. "Unfiltered HTML" is restricted to Super Admins on multisite. To enable "Unfiltered HTML" content for site Administrators and Editors, you will need to use a [code snippet](https://kellenmace.com/add-unfiltered_html-capability-to-admins-or-editors-in-wordpress-multisite/), the [Unfiltered MU](https://wordpress.org/plugins-wp/unfiltered-mu/) plugin, or something similar. Regrettably, this is a WordPress restriction and needs to be handled outside of Shaicon Block.
